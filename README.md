üé¨ INTRODUCTION-

Hello my fellow coders and viewers. It's bittersweet to think this is my final project with Flatiron School. I want to truly thank you for not only just the knowledge but for the support and kindness this past year. I've learned alot and understand I still have more to learn, but beacuse of the skills you have given me I believe I will make you proud. After months and months of studying and practicing, I'd like to present to you my capstone project "Cyber-Flixs'. I'm excited to showcase all skills and knowledge I have gained this past year to execute this project.  . I mean it when I say I have found a new love of creativity I never imagined falling for. Coding with you has picked my brain apart in so many ways. It makes me view what the 'standard' status quo of creativity truly is differently. It's not art, it's a masterpiece. And for anyone who says 'oh it's so easy I can do that', I'd love to see them walk in our shoes. Agian from the bottom of my heart, thank you, I will miss you Flatiron. ‚ù§Ô∏è


üé¨ What is the inspiration behind Cyber-Flixs?

As I got closer to the capstone start date, I kept thinking I want to try and build something that I see daily in the real world. I wanted to create a Netflix or Hulu like application. I think the biggest challenge while building the application because I was so focused on that idea, was stopping myself from designing to much and truly focusing on the core functionalities right away. But I got there eventually! One thing I learned about myself throughout this year also, was if I don't truly understand something, I put a lot of time into understanding why things work the way they do. I remember being so stuck on sessions and cookies that I would not let the idea go until I knew exactly what was going on! And now I don't even want to eat a cookie! But I would say my inspiration was platforms like Netflix and to see if I could get some what close to that type of frontend design.


üé¨ The ideas behind the application.

I knew right away I wanted to have video content be apart of the application. On Netflix right when you login a trailer to a show or movie is playing. This gets the user excited about whats being or will be featured on the platform. In past projects I had not played with video content and I was very curious on how I would make that work with my seed data. You never know until you try. The next thing I wanted to present on the application was an interactive NavBar. When a user clicks on a genre theres potential for a hundred diffrent movies to pop up under that genre. Lets make it easy for the user, give them a search input when they click on a genre option in the navbar. I wanted to challenge myself however and see if I could make the search input disappear once a user clicks back to home. Same with when a user clicks on actors in the NavBar. I no longer want there to be a search input for movies but for actors. I enjoyed thinking that process through and how I could make it work. I also enjoyed being able to tell the user where they are in the application based off of the red text highlight in the NavBar. That was a little challenging at first. I thought I could get away with that just by a simple state toggle and that was not the case. Overall there's a lot more I know I would love to implement on this application. It's a great start and foundation to build off post graduation.
